        Mental health, an individual overall well-being is often ignored, stigmatized and not properly 
understood, one individual decided to make a change in creating awareness for the benighted. 
Armed with an acute understanding of the immeasurable value of their mental health, they set 
out to kindle that awareness in others. 
This visionary assembled a group of proficient individuals, and they carved out a discreet haven 
where they discussed the significance of mental health and its overall well-being. Word of this 
refuge spread, drawing people from all walks of life into its embrace, transforming it into a place 
not just for moments of despair, but a daily pilgrimage.
Within these walls, laughter therapy, meditation, and artistic expression became tools for 
emotional exploration. Judgment and fear found no quarter in this compassionate space. 
Empathetic and caring listeners stood ready, offering solace and support.
The sanctity of this place transcended its physical boundaries, becoming enshrined in the city’s 
constitution as a fundamental human right. Access was a guarantee for all, generously ensured 
by the government, and conversations about mental well-being became as common as any 
other discussion.
Mental Health Day, celebrated on the 10th of October, transformed into a day of profound 
significance. It became a testament to people’s unwavering commitment to this universal 
human right. Society collectively realized that it wasn’t achieved by shouting from rooftops, but 
through conversations and a safe space for individuals to share their stories without shame
